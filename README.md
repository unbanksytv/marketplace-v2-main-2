<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Reservoir Market v2 is an open source marketplace built with Reservoir APIs that enables access to instant liquidity aggregated from major marketplace. Odyssey is a community-driven marketplace and aggregator in one. It lets you analyze and purchase many NFTs at once from multiple marketplaces. A common use case that requires buying multiple NFTs in a single transaction is floor-sweeping, which is slang for purchasing numerous of the lowest-priced NFTs from a specific collection. The app compiles NFT listings from popular markets, as well as allows users to offer their assets natively on Odyssey. Listing options include floor price, trait floor price, and in the same flow also list on OS, LR, etc, ...

Collections are shown in the order of their one-day trading volume by default, and essential data elements such as floor price, number of owners, and other price and volume indicators are displayed at a glance. It also displays the scarcity of certain NFTs and allows users to view the floor price for specific attributes and make offers on a collection level, or make an offer on very specific traits, and get a clear indication of the current floor prices for these traits. 

The portfolio page allows users to see all of the Ethereum-based NFTs in their wallet, and it aims to integrate NFTs into other networks in the future.
